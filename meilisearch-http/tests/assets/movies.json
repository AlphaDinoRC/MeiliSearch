The sounds muffled by the water merge with the screams of fleeing people. It is 1980, the earth shakes, the palace collapses, but under the rubble you can hear the cry of a newborn baby still alive. Ten years later, we find that new-born baby as it survives as it can on the streets of Naples, nobody's son. Vivid memories of a criminal education that made him what he is: Ciro Di Marzio, the Immortal. Prequel of the \"Gomorra\" tv show.",

    "overview": "Harry Sandmann (Michael Foerster) is head of a Munich advertising agency and must develop an inspiring idea for the market introduction of a Bavarian whiskey brand. So he goes to Radlkofen in Lower Bavaria to pay a visit to the carpenter Leopold Wanninger (Johannes Glocke). When he arrives at the workshop, he sees Wanninger's son and realizes that he looks exactly like Jesus. Suddenly Sandmann has an idea that could possibly solve all of his problems. His idea takes shape: The whiskey is supposed to be called \"Holy Spirit\" and with Leopold's son Gustl (Tom Schuster), Sandmann has the perfect figure to start an advertising campaign. As a whiskey drinking Jesus, Gustl quickly becomes a media star, and sales of Bavarian spirits are skyrocketing. But at the height of success there is a tragedy: A young woman is cruelly murdered and of all people Gustl is said to be the prime suspect! Can it really be that the whiskey-loving Jesus did this to a woman?",

To kick things up a notch, they decide – why not? – to make a video of themselves trying out every position in The Joy of Sex in one marathon three-hour session.  It seems like a great idea – until they discover that their most private video is no longer private.  With their reputations on the line, they know they’re just one click away from being laid bare to the world... but as their race to reclaim their video leads to a night they'll never forget, they'll find that their video will expose even more than they bargained for.",

Paris, the Trojan prince, convinces Helen, Queen of Sparta, to leave her husband Menelaus, and sail with him back to Troy. After Menelaus finds out that his wife was taken by the Trojans, he asks his brother Agamemnom to help him get her back. Agamemnon sees this as an opportunity for power. So they set off with 1,000 ships holding 50,000 Greeks to Troy. With the help of Achilles, the Greeks are able to fight the never before defeated Trojans.",

But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past.

Through powerful images pristinely photographed in 70mm and a dynamic music score, the film illuminates the links between humanity and the rest of the nature, showing how our life cycle mirrors the rhythm of the planet.",

Cloud Atlas explores how the actions and consequences of individual lives impact one another throughout the past, the present and the future. Action, mystery and romance weave through the story as one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero and a single act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution in the distant future.  Based on the award winning novel by David Mitchell. Directed by Tom Tykwer and the Wachowskis.",
